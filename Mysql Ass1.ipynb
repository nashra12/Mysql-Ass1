    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically. SQL databases use structured query language and have a fixed schema, suitable for complex queries and transactions. NoSQL databases are schema-less, handle unstructured data, and offer high scalability and flexibility for big data and real-time web applications.\n",
